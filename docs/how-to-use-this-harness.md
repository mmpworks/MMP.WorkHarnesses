# How to use this harness

This guide is for the moment right after you clone MMP.WorkHarnesses for a
new project. It covers what you get out of the box, how to run it, and how to
grow it into whatever you're building.

## What this harness is for

Most new projects start the same way: a server that serves a single-page app,
an API under it, a place to add a database or a second service later, and a
dashboard that already looks finished. Building that skeleton from scratch
costs a day you'd rather spend on the actual product.

MMP.WorkHarnesses is that skeleton, already built. Clone it, rename it, and
you have a working .NET 10 server, a Vue 3 dashboard, structured logging, a
docker compose root, and two fuzz test suites, all wired together and all
passing. The one feature it ships is a **STAT** button that scans the machine
for installed AI coding tools, and it exists to prove the stack works end to
end, from browser click to backend probe to rendered card. You'll likely
replace it with your own first screen.

This harness also doubles as the base for MMPWorks screen-recorded content.
The dashboard was designed for camera before the first commit shipped.

## Prerequisites

- **.NET 10 SDK** — the server targets `net10.0`.
- **Node.js 22+** — the SPA build and the Vitest suite need it. The Docker
  image pins `node:22-alpine`.
- **Docker** (optional) — only needed if you want the compose path instead of
  running the server and SPA directly.

## Run it

### Dev loop

Two terminals, two dev servers, one proxy between them:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — the API
dotnet run --project CSharp/src/WorkHarness.Server

# Terminal 2 — the SPA, hot-reloading
cd CSharp/web && npm install && npm run dev
```

Vite serves the SPA at `:5173` and proxies `/api/*` requests to the server at
`:5090`. Open `http://localhost:5173` and edit Vue components. Changes show
up without a rebuild.

### Production-shaped run

```bash
cd CSharp/web && npm install && npm run build && cd ../..
dotnet run --project CSharp/src/WorkHarness.Server
```

`npm run build` compiles the SPA into `CSharp/web/dist`. The server checks
for that folder at startup and serves it as static files with a
history-mode fallback to `index.html`. If it isn't there, the server still
starts and answers `/` with a plain-text reminder to build the SPA first.
Open `http://localhost:5090`.

### Docker

```bash
cd docker && docker compose up --build
```

The `Dockerfile` is a three-stage build: a Node stage compiles the SPA, a
.NET SDK stage publishes the server, and a slim ASP.NET runtime stage copies
both in. The container answers on `:5090`.

## The dashboard and the STAT flow

The dashboard loads, fetches `/api/hello` for a footer status line, and
waits. Press **STAT** and the frontend calls `/api/stats`. The backend runs
`AiSystemProbe.CaptureAsync`, a version check plus a live process scan for
each catalog entry (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Codex, Cursor, Gemini,
Ollama), and returns a snapshot: machine info, and one card's worth of data
per AI system. The dashboard renders each as a `SystemCard`, showing whether
it's installed, whether it's currently running, and how many processes and
how much memory it's using.

> 💡 **Quick picture.** Think of STAT the way a hospital uses the word: a
> fast, on-demand check of vital signs. The server looks only when you ask.
> There's no background timer and no polling loop.

Every value that reaches a Vue component passes through a sanitize layer
first (`CSharp/web/src/api/sanitize.ts`). The backend's JSON is external
data as far as the frontend is concerned, and the sanitize layer's job is to
turn anything malformed into a safe default rather than let a bad field
crash a component. This is why the frontend fuzz suite (below) can throw
broken payloads at the app and expect it to keep rendering.

## Logging: what a Herald-in-native-mode call site looks like

The server logs through **Herald.OSS running in native mode**. A call site
names a category and a level, then a structured template:

```csharp
log.Information(appCategory, "Hello endpoint served for harness {Harness}",
    new LogProperty("Harness", "CSharp"));
```

Domain levels read the same way, just with a level that names what's
happening instead of a generic severity word:

```csharp
log.Log(WorkHarnessLevels.CommsLevel, appCategory, "STAT probe requested",
    properties: null, context: null, eventId: null);
```

Both lines are real, from `Program.cs`'s `/api/stats` handler.

### The 14-level set

Most loggers give you a severity scale: verbose, debug, information,
warning, error, fatal. This harness keeps that scale but splits three of its
rungs in two, and adds four levels of its own. `WorkHarnessLevels.cs` is the
single place the set and its rank order live:

```
sys.verbose, verbose,
sys.debug,   debug,
sys.information, information,
comms, money, math, simulation,
sys.warning, warning,
error, fatal
```

The `sys.*` half of each pair is for framework noise: anything logged by a
`Microsoft.*` or `System.*` category, which in an ASP.NET Core app means
startup messages, dependency-injection chatter, hosting diagnostics. The
plain half is for the app's own events. `SystemAwareHeraldProvider` is the
piece that sorts one from the other: it wraps every `ILogger` ASP.NET Core
hands out, checks the category name, and routes to the `sys.` level when the
category starts with `Microsoft` or `System`.

`comms`, `money`, `math`, and `simulation` are domain levels: the harness's
own vocabulary for the kinds of events it raises, sitting between
`information` and the warning band. The `/api/stats` handler logs `comms`
when a probe request comes in and `math` when it tallies the results, so the
level itself tells a reader what kind of thing happened as well as how bad
it was.

> 💡 **Quick picture.** Think of the level set as two lanes on one highway.
> A `sys.information` event and a plain `information` event matter at the
> same severity; one came from the framework and one came from your code.
> Filtering by rank works across both lanes, and the lane tells you which is
> which.

Error and fatal stay shared between framework and app on purpose: a failure
is a failure, whoever raised it.

### Why the harness logs this way

Naming the level after the domain event is CUPID's *Domain-based* property
in practice. `comms`, `money`, `math`, and `simulation` come from what the
app does. A reader scanning the log file for money-related events greps
`money` instead of cross-referencing a severity number against a legend.

Splitting framework noise from application signal at the level, rather than
by category filtering after the fact, means one `WithMinimumLevel` threshold
can drop verbose ASP.NET Core startup chatter while keeping the harness's
own `information`-level events. The reverse works too, if you want the
framework's verbosity without your own.

### Where the logs land

- **Console** — every log line prints to the terminal you started the
  server from.
- **File** — `logs/workharness-.log` (relative to the working directory the
  server runs from), rolling daily, five days retained, capped at 10 MB per
  file before Herald starts a new one.

On shutdown, `await herald.DisposeAsync()` runs in a `finally` block so any
buffered file-sink output is written before the process exits.

### Packages

| Package | Version | What it's for |
|---|---|---|
| `Herald.OSS` | 0.12.11 | The logging engine |
| `MMP.Herald.Sinks.File` | 0.2.1 | The rolling file sink |

Herald.OSS is open source. The engine behind these call sites is public and
ready to read at
[github.com/mmpworks/Herald.OSS](https://github.com/mmpworks/Herald.OSS).

### Two upstream findings, pinned as tests

`HeraldLoggingTests.cs` carries two tests that pin current engine behavior
the harness works around, both reported upstream to Herald.OSS:

- **Custom-level events bypass the minimum-level filter.** Herald's
  built-in floor check works for the standard level set, but an event
  logged at a custom level (`comms`, `money`, and the rest) currently
  passes through regardless of the configured minimum. The workaround is
  `WorkHarnessLevels.AtOrAbove(...)`, a `WithCustomFilter` that re-checks
  the floor using the harness's own rank order. `Program.cs` and every test
  pipeline install it alongside `WithMinimumLevel`.
- **The native and Serilog-compat surfaces tokenize templates differently.**
  An unclosed template brace (`"unmatched { open"`) passes through the
  native surface used here, and throws `InvalidOperationException` on the
  Serilog-compat adapter given the same input.

Both tests are marked `PINNED ENGINE BEHAVIOR` / `PINNED ENGINE BUG` in
comments. If either starts failing, Herald changed the behavior it pins.
Revisit the workaround; do not weaken the test.

## How to extend the harness

### Add a new API endpoint

Add a `MapGet` (or `MapPost`, etc.) call in `Program.cs` under `/api/*`:

```csharp
app.MapGet("/api/ping", () => Results.Ok(new { pong = true }));
```

Log inside the handler the way the existing endpoints do:
`log.Information(category, template, ...)` for a severity level, or
`log.Log(...)` for one of the domain levels. Pass a structured message
template rather than an interpolated string, so the fields stay queryable in
whatever sink reads the log later.

### Add a new AI system to the STAT probe

`AiSystemProbe.Catalog` in `CSharp/src/WorkHarness.Server/AiSystems.cs` is a
flat array of catalog rows. One row is one system, and adding a system means
adding a row:

```csharp
new("windsurf", "Windsurf", ["windsurf --version"], ["windsurf"]),
```

The four fields are the system's ID, its display name, the shell commands to
try for a version string (first one that exits 0 wins), and the process-name
substrings to match during the live scan. Add the row, and the probe, the
API response, and the dashboard card all pick it up automatically. No other
file changes.

This is the *Unix philosophy* letter of CUPID. The catalog does one job:
describe a system. Version probing, process scanning, JSON serialization,
and card rendering all compose off that one flat structure, so no system
needs its own code path.

### Add a new service to docker compose

`docker/docker-compose.yml` keeps the harness's own service
(`workharness`) untouched and expects new services as additional blocks
below it: a database, a second frontend, a worker process.

```yaml
postgres:
  image: postgres:17-alpine
  environment:
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: dev
  ports:
    - "5432:5432"
```

The compose file already carries commented-out examples in this form. Copy
one, adapt it, uncomment.

### Replace hello-world with your real app

There's no scaffolding to tear out. The pattern to follow:

1. Keep `/api/hello` if you like it as a health check, or delete it.
2. Add your real endpoints next to `/api/stats` in `Program.cs`, or split
   them into their own file the way `AiSystems.cs` keeps the STAT logic out
   of `Program.cs`.
3. Replace `App.vue`'s STAT button and card grid with your real UI. The
   `MachineStrip`, `SystemCard`, `LoadingState`, and `ErrorPanel` components
   are yours to keep, adapt, or delete. Keep the sanitize-layer pattern in
   `CSharp/web/src/api/sanitize.ts` whatever your API returns. Treating
   server responses as untrusted external data is a habit that pays for
   itself the first time a backend field changes form.
4. Update the fuzz suites (below) to match your new API surface instead of
   deleting them. A harness with no tests is just an empty folder with extra
   steps.

## Running the test suites

Both ends carry a seeded fuzz suite. The random generator starts from a
fixed seed, so a failing case replays the same input every run. You debug
the failure instead of chasing it.

```bash
# Backend — xUnit
dotnet test CSharp/tests/WorkHarness.Server.Tests

# Frontend — Vitest
cd CSharp/web && npm run test
```

### What the backend suite checks

`HttpFuzzTests` runs 300 requests with randomized HTTP methods, paths, and
query strings against the live server through `WebApplicationFactory`. There
is no real network socket, just the in-process ASP.NET Core pipeline. Three
invariants hold across every request: the server never returns a 5xx, path
traversal attempts (`../`, percent-encoded `..%2f`, backslash variants)
never leak a file outside the SPA root, and the `/api/hello` and
`/api/stats` endpoints survive arbitrary methods and bodies without
crashing.

`VersionOutputFuzzTests` runs 10,000 iterations of random byte blobs
(control characters, wide unicode, mixed line endings) through the CLI
version-string parser and checks it never throws and always returns either
`null` or a single trimmed line.

### What the frontend suite checks

`fuzz.spec.ts` takes a valid `/api/stats` payload and mutates it at random,
deleting a field or replacing it with `NaN`, a huge string, or nested
garbage. A seeded pseudo-random generator drives it, so the same mutation
sequence runs every time. It checks three layers:

- the format helpers always return a string, whatever they're given;
- `sanitizeStats` always produces the contract shape the Vue components
  expect;
- a full `App.vue` mount never throws a component error, whether the
  response is malformed JSON, a non-2xx status, or a rejected request.

## Non-goals (v1)

Auth, persistence, SignalR, and multi-project templating machinery wait for
a project that needs them. The seams stay open: a stable `/api` route
prefix, and a compose file that expects one service per external dependency.
See [`PRD.md`](PRD.md) for the full v1 scope.
